## Description

Cart to Kitchen is an all-in-one app that allows users to discover and search for recipes, save recipes to favorites, add ingredients from specific recipes to a grocery list, and search for nearby grocery stores with Google maps integrated functionality.

This project was made for the UCSD Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp using the Spoonacular API, Google Maps/Places API, javascript/jquery/lodash.js, bootstrap, and firebase live databases.

## Roadmap

In the future, we would like to expand on the grocery list functionality so that it becomes more of a pantry management system. Additionally, we would like to increase maps functionality so that it will automatically show any grocery stores near the user's location. Alternatively, we would integrate some sort of grocery or food delivery services onto our platform.
